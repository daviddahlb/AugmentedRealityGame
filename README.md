Once project is opened in Unity, go to File -> Build Settings, select Android, then press the Switch Platform button. 
To confirm your SDK is properly configured, go to Edit -> Preferences. Select External Tools, and Look under Android, and find the SDK field. Direct this entry box to where you SDK is located.
